Hi my name is Oregunwa Oluwadamilola Michael. I am a programmer that is interested in changing the world
I believe that all information should be free and open to all.
I am currently learning web3 technologies so I am probably going to be like Alan Turing but for the web
I am looking to collaborate on any cool projects that anyone has.
I know **Rust**, **Python**, **Javascript** and **Dart/Flutter**.
